<h1>Rock paper scissors</h1>

This is my second project from The Odin Project. Rock Paper Scissors is a simple web implementation of the popular hand game, played within the Developer Console in a web browser, and is built entirely from JavaScript.

<h2>What I've learnt</h2>

I've gained skills in planning out a new project, breaking the game down into the various components/problems/functions, and working through each one in order to create the overall program. I've also learnt about the Math.random method, While loops, and how to overcome an invalid user prompt. 

<h2>How the game works</h2>

The game takes both an input from the user, and a random choice for the computer opponent using the Math.random method. 

The game is played for five rounds, and uses While loops for both the user input (to account for an invalid input), and the countdown for the remaining rounds. A score counter keeps track of the human and computer scores each round to accumulate a total score at the end of the game.
